# Using this repo

we are using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static website generator to build this page.
It's very easy to use and we don't need a giant bunch of dependencies while using wordpress, typo3 or other dynamic site generators.

All pages relying on simple [markdown files](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)

Used Theme: [Minimal-Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
